       "I have been a victim of Identity Theft. I have been trying to work with the Credit Reporting Agency but they are refusing to honor my valid identity theft case thus these incorrect/fraudulent items are still on my credit report and they must be removed immediately but they are do not belong to me. I have provided all of the proof to show that I was a victim of Identity Theft and that to the best of my knowledge these fraudulent accounts do not belong to me. Please take immediate action on my behalf so I can have these items removed, deleted and permanently blocked from my credit report, so that I can get back on track to a normal life. \\n\\nRegards \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          27\n",
       "I have sent several requests to Experian requesting an investigation of my accounts. It has been months and I still have not received a response to my concerns. The only thing I have received is some automated rejection letter stating that they wo n't do anything to help me ( please see attached ). \\nThis has to be a violation of my rights. I feel like I 've already wasted so much time just trying to get Experian to look at the errors on my credit report and I 'm so frustrated that Experian is intentionally not responding to my inquiries. I need to have this issue resolved immediately. There are many things I need to do with my life and they all involve my credit. But I am not able to move forward all because of this credit bureau! \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    26\n",

       "Ten years ago I had a credit card and unfortunately my account was at {$10000.00}. Asset Acceptance now has control of my debt from this card. I have been paying through my work checks and have paid off {$2000.00} of the initial {$10000.00} owed. When I called XXXX XXXX, 2015 to settle this debt I was told that even though Asset Acceptance had my debt that they could not do anything and it was now with a law firm, XXXX and that they would have to take care of it. I received no resolution through Asset Acceptance, only sending me somewhere else. When I called XXXX, over ten times, I still did not receive a call back. Their voicemail stated that in order to get in contact with me I had to leave my social security number and I did not feel comfortable leaving something so secure on a voicemail. Finally after almost twenty attempts I was able to get ahold of XXXX XXXX, who bullied me to give him my name/social security number/phone number and then firmly stated he must have my address. I refused to give my address because I was advised that they do not need any information other than my name and social. He then bullied me into giving him my address by saying he would not work with me if I did not give him this information and that he will hang up and then to have a nice day so I gave in and gave him my information. He then told me that they had a different amount on file as payment received, about {$1000.00} less than what I had actually paid. XXXX then went on to tell me that if I wanted to settle then I would have to pay 83 % of my debit. The figure he gave me, over {$8000.00}, would be my settling payment. That settling payment with the amount I have already paid, {$2000.00} according to my previous employer that I have receipts of payment from, would total more than the actual {$10000.00} I initially owed. That means in order to settle I would be paying over 105 % of my debt to someone who told me I could ONLY settle for 83 %. This does not make sense. I asked if anything could be done, that I do not have that kind of money but could settle for less, and he refused everything and anything. I then expressed again that I did not have that kind of money and would have to file for bankruptcy and he said, \" That 's fine. Just make sure you contact us and send us notice. '' Again, no negotiation or compromise. Settling does not mean pay in full. This was debt from ten years ago. I then expressed that I would file a complaint to the CFPB and he did not care. After all attempts XXXX XXXX would still not help. Asset Acceptance can not do anything, which they are the ones who actually have my debt, and XXXX will not settle for anything less than 83 %.

       "Bank of America has demonstrated an on-going level of incompetence, callous disregard for the wellbeing of its customer and negligence in their responsibility to adequately guide a client through a loan process. Because of their unprofessional behavior we have suffered extraordinary emotional hardship and they have inflicted a financial burden on us not initially intended when we applied for the loan. \\n\\nOne of many issues is as follows. After going through an extraordinarily difficult mortgage finalization process I wrote to the president of Bank of America. Within a very short time I received calls from a corporate representative in XXXX, another representative in XXXX and a regional District Sales Manager. \\n\\nMy issue, at this point, is the way they have opted to getting around paying what they said they would pay me. In response to my complaint they agreed to cover the cost of the house appraisal and to honor their \" guaranteed close '' agreement. In a discussion with the District Sales Manager he stated that a reimbursement of travel costs due to their inadequate notification that our initial close date could not be met. We discussed the rates to be utilized to arrive at a figure and he said that actual receipts would not be needed. He asked if this approach would be acceptable. I told him to email all that we have talked about and I will review it with my wife. Here is what the representative from the corporate office wrote me soon after : \" XXXX XXXX, I spoke with XXXX and he asked me to pass along this information to you regarding your request for reimbursement. If you have any questions or need anything additional, please feel free to reach out to XXXX at XXXX. I have cc 'd him on this email as well. \\nRegarding Reimbursement : There were XXXX trips back and forth between XXXX and XXXX. The trip is approximately XXXX miles. This brings the total mileage to XXXX miles. At $ XXXX/mile that would bring the total mileage reimbursement to {$620.00}. \\nThe hotel room was {$87.00} a night for XXXX nights totaling a hotel reimbursement in the amount of {$170.00}. Per diem for food is $ XXXX/day/person. For XXXX people over a 4 day period that brings the total food reimbursement to {$600.00}. \\nThis brings the total reimbursement to just under {$1400.00}. \\nWe have already agreed to refund your appraisal fee in the amount of {$460.00}, which is currently in process. You are also going to be receiving your Close On Time Commitment Payout in the amount of {$500.00}. This brings the total reimbursement that is already in process to {$960.00}. In order to bring us to the {$1400.00} total, we will be issuing you a check in the amount of {$440.00} to cover the difference. \\n{$620.00} ( mileage ) + {$170.00} ( lodging ) + {$600.00} ( food cost ) = {$1300.00} ( Rounded up to {$1400.00} ) {$1400.00} ( agreed reimbursement ) - {$460.00} ( appraisal refund in process ) - {$500.00} ( COTC in process ) = {$440.00} We will issue this check to the new address. Can you please confirm this is where you would like to have this mailed? \\nThank you very much and have a nice weekend! \\nSincerely, Consumer Lending Client Experience '' As you can see they created a final reimbursement figure by taking one issue, the travel reimbursement and then subtracting the \" in-process '' reimbursements. My strong contention is that there are three separate and distinct issues to be reimbursed. The three issues would total {$2300.00}. By doing a subtraction of two previous reimbursements for different issues they have substantially reduced their total payout. I find such an action to be cheap, insulting and a truly unprofessional way to address the needs of an aggrieved party to a horrific mortgage loan process as reviewed in my letter to the president ( attached ). A financial institution with the reach and impact that Bank of America has must be held to a higher standard and account for its actions. \\n     1\n",
